To install the PEBKAC Industries Launch Escape System:

1) Copy the contents of the GameData folder inside this archive to the GameData folder inside your KSP install.
2) (optional) Copy the contents of the Saves folder to the saves folder inside your KSP install.

The savegame files include example spacecraft that show how the LES can be used with the stock Mk1 and Mk1-2 capsules.

Thanks and have fun!
