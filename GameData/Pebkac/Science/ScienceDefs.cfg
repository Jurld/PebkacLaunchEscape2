	RESULTS
	{
		default = Why haven't you jettisoned the LES?

		KerbinFlyingLow = You run an atmospheric analysis, recording various measurements like temperature, pressure and atmospheric composition.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It seems there is very little atmosphere at these altitudes. Make sure you're properly suited up if you plan on going outside.
		KerbinSpaceLow = Atmospheric pressure reads zero! This most assuredly indicates we must be in space now! Jettison this bad-boy!
